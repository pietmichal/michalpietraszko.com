# Mistake shared by React and Ruby On Rails.

Their cores are bound to specific language.

If they used lingua franca of programming languages such as C.

Then you could use React abstraction in any language and context.

You could create Rails-style apps in any language.

You'd just need a binding.

I might be idealistic here and had simplified the concept too much in my head.

Not being bound to a specific language prevents software rot.

React would be react. Want to use React with C++ and DirectX? 

Use the bindings.

Rails would be rails. You know Python but not Ruby and you want to use benefits of Rails? 

Use the bindings.

Blitz.js tries to solve the same problems but using a different language.

I'd take the point that Blitz.js uses React at its core, but what if it all was written in C?

React's abstraction could become a feature of Ruby on Rails.

As a side note - this post is purely speculative so please take it with a pinch of salt.

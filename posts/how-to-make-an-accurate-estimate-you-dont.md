title: How to make an accurate estimate? You don't.
description: Recent tweets about estimates made me worry about how average developer or team member preceives estimation.

Recent popular tweet made me worry because people might agree with it for a wrong reason.

Without calling out people - all of it boils down to this quote:

> Don't trust developer estimates.

Having to say it is already a sign of a problem. This implies that a developer is a person that you cannot trust.

This sentiment makes people completely miss the point, atagonizes product teams against software engineers and make less experienced folks feel bad.

The issue even beyond twitter. Many great books and engineers talk abot out. I bet you have been given an advice to double or triple your estimates.

Let us see what Wikipedia has to say:

> Estimation (or estimating) is the process of finding an estimate, 
> or approximation, which is a value that is usable for some purpose even if input data 
> may be incomplete, uncertain, or unstable. 

Please make a mental note of it - **the word estimate implies uncertainty**.

## Dealing with uncertainty.

Reality changes every day and new variables come into play. What worked a month ago is very likely not to work this month.

Especially when it comes to such a fast paced environment that is software.

What we do carries a risk. We should focus more on reducing the risk. We cannot completely remove it.

Focus on the objective itself and give yourself a timeframe to achieve it. 

Be it a two-week sprint goal, a quarterly objective measured by key results or something that you check results every month.

If an idea proves to be insufficient, react and adjust immediatelly.

And by an "objective", I don't mean "finish user story A, B and C". I mean the outcome you are contributing towards.

What do we call this? **Being agile.**

## But everyone wants estimates. They need to know when job will be done. What do I do then?

This is problem is contextual. There is no one-size fits all solution for you as an individual.

If your team is given a list of things to be done without questions asked then give them what they want and play by their rules.

If you agree with organisation's reasoning, go for it.

If you are not, you can try influencing people around you (which is a great skill to obtain) or consider different options in your career.

I am not a big fan of estimates in software projects. Be it story points or actual man-hours. 

Estimates mean nothing when it comes to delivering actual value. I can understand using story points as a third wheel for development teams that are inexperienced with agile way of thinking.

The truth is, if you need to achieve something, you just do anything necessary to make it happen.

Some people might say that you want to take the quickest thing to do. This is wrong on so many levels.  

You don't reduce risk by taking the lowest estimated ticket. You reduce risk by constant validation of your actions.

Do you need to increase conversion in certain channels? Do anything to improve it, then measure it, and continue doing it or take learnings and pivot. 

Rinse and repeat until you achieve your objective.
